The rich tapestry of Indian recipes and regional cuisines may be explored by users through dynamic interactive map and table visualisations.

The applicationÂ effortlessly takes users through the complex flavours and cultural subtleties of Indian food with its user-friendly layout and many functionalities.

This documentation provides an overview of the features and objectives of the "Taste of India" application. Readers will learn about the characteristics of the programme, how it meets culinary demands, and how it allows users to explore India's rich culinary legacy. The brochure also describes the goals of utilising the application while providing a preview of the smooth functioning and usability users may anticipate.

## Problem Statement and Literature Review

The "Taste of India" application addresses several key problems faced by individuals interested in exploring cuisine:

**Limited Access to Comprehensive Information and the unknown input details:** Many individuals interested in Indian cuisine struggle to find comprehensive information about regional dishes, their ingredients, and preparation methods. Existing recipe databases may lack diversity and fail to provide in-depth insights into the diverse culinary landscape of India. Several studies, such as recipe analysis and meal preparation research, have been conducted using large datasets in the field of food research[@najdenkoska_infrastructure_2021]. Additionally, users often input queries in natural language format for recipe search purposes, which requires the application to effectively implement information retrieval systems[@yasukawa_concurrence_2017]. The Taste of India application has inputs on dish name, flavour, course, region and state which helps refine the search and gives accurate results.

**Complexity in Recipe Filtering:** Existing platforms may offer filtering options, but they are often limited in scope and effectiveness. Users may encounter difficulties in filtering recipes based on specific criteria such as dietary restrictions, flavour profiles, or regional cuisines, leading to frustration and dissatisfaction with the search experience. A method has been proposed for recipe recommendation [@mao_recipe_2016], which utilizes the cosine theorem and term frequency to assist restaurants in recommending the top dishes. The Taste of India program helps the user select the main ingredients he wants to be in the dish without compromising on the taste.

**Lack of Interactive Visualizations:** Many recipe platforms lack interactive visualizations that allow users to explore Indian cuisine in an engaging and immersive manner. Static lists of recipes and text-based search results may fail to capture the diversity and richness of Indian culinary traditions, limiting users' ability to discover new and exciting dishes. An algorithm called Self-Organizing Map was developed by extending frameworks for interactive visualization[@schreck_visual_2009]. The Taste Of India app helps in the visualization of data, presenting dish names from different regions on the map in a cluster format. Users can zoom in and hover over the points for the dish name.

The "Taste of India" application seeks to give users a smooth and rewarding experience as they explore the exciting world of Indian food by solving these issues. By providing users with extensive filtering options, dynamic visualisations, and easy-to-use search functions, the programme enables users to explore and discover the rich and varied culinary legacy of India.

## Features, Functionality and Usability

Designed with user experience in mind, the 'Taste of India' application boasts a plethora of features, functionalities, and unparalleled usability, elevating the exploration of Indian cuisine to new heights.

The application is structured into three distinct tabs, each offering unique functionality and features to enhance the user experience.

In the first tab, labeled "Recipe Search," users are presented with five input fields designed to facilitate precise recipe discovery. These inputs include:

Search by Dish: Users can directly input the name of the dish they are searching for.



**Select Diet Type:** Users are provided with options to filter recipes based on dietary preferences, choosing between vegetarian and non-vegetarian options.



**Select Flavor Profile:** Users can narrow down their search by selecting from various flavor profiles such as spicy, sour, sweet, and bitter.



**Select Course:** Users are prompted to specify the course of the meal they are interested in, with options including dessert, main course, snack, and starter.



**Select Region:** Users have the option to explore recipes based on their regional origins, with choices ranging from south, east, west, north, north-east, and central regions of India.



Additionally, users can utilize the search bar located at the top-right corner of the tab to perform more general searches.

The search results are dynamically visualized in a data table format, featuring eleven columns including state, dish name, region, cook time, prep time, ingredients, flavor profile, course, latitude, and longitude. As users input their preferences, the table automatically filters the data to provide relevant recipe information.

The second tab, labeled "Regional Cuisine Explorer," offers users a data visualization experience through an interactive map interface.

Users can utilize the zoom-in and zoom-out functionalities to navigate the map and explore different regions. Initially, the dishes from various regions are displayed as clusters on the map. As users zoom in, the clusters further divide, eventually revealing red data points representing specific dishes within each region and state. Hovering over these data points enables users to view the dish names associated with each location, facilitating a deeper understanding of regional cuisines.

In the third tab, aptly named "Ingredients Search," users are presented with a unique opportunity to explore recipes based on their preferred ingredients. This tab is designed to cater to users who may have specific ingredients on hand and are seeking inspiration for dishes to prepare.

Users are provided with five input fields where they can input their chosen ingredients. Once the user has inputted their desired ingredients, they can initiate the search by clicking on the designated button.

The search results are dynamically visualized in a data table format, showcasing the top 10 dish names along with their respective regions and flavor profiles. This presentation allows users to quickly and efficiently browse through the suggested recipes and identify options that align with their preferences and available ingredients.

Through the utilisation of this function, users may uncover novel and captivating dishes customised to their preferences, thus augmenting their culinary exploration and diversifying their recipe collection. The items Search page offers a handy and user-friendly platform for recipe research, perfect for those who want to try new flavours or are just searching for inventive ways to use items they already have.
